            <h3>Founding of Rexburg</h3>
            <p>The city of Rexburg was founded in March 1883 when an intrepid group of pioneers decided to settle
                along the banks of the Teton River. They had been sent by church leaders in Salt Lake City, under
                the direction of Thomas E. Ricks, to settle the Upper Snake River Valley. The new community, named
                Rexburg after their leader (Ricks being German for Rex or King) quickly attracted men and women
                eager to bring industry and civilization to the West. By the time Idaho entered the Union as the
                43rd state in 1890, Rexburg was the second largest city in the state.</p>

            <h3>Teton Dam Flood</h3>
            <p>On Saturday, June 5, 1976, The Teton Dam gave way allowing 2,000,000 cubic feet per second through
               the breach floodingthe surrounding area. The Teton River flows through the industrial, commercial, 
               and residential districts of north Rexburg. A significant reason for the massive damage in the 
               community was the location of a lumber yard directly upstream. When the flood waters hit, thousands
               of logs were washed into town. Dozens of them hit a bulk gasoline-storage tank a few hundred yards 
               away. The gasoline ignited and sent flaming slicks adrift on the racing water. Disaster victims filed over 
               7,563 claims for a total of $322 million.

            <h3>Legacy Flight Museum</h3>
            <p>The Legacy Flight Museum was founded in 2006. The goal of the museum’s volunteers is to give guests the opportunity
                 to see up close and personal some of the aircraft that United States Military Veterans flew as they served our
                 country and provided us with the freedoms that we enjoy today.</p>
