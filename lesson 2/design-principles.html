            <p>Google does an excellent job of keeping their home page simple. The only real option is to input your question.<br>
            Their are buttons for you to click that will take your to other google products such as google drive and gmail. <br>
            Due to the size and location that they are at they don't pull my attention away from the reason I came to the website.<br>
            This makes the website incredibly easy to use no matter the skill level of the user. </p>

            <p>Youtube is designed to maximize your time watching videos. The best way to do that is making it easy to <br>
            click of videos. Each video has a thumbnail and a title, and you can navigate to that video by clicking on either.<br>
            The channels you are subscribed to are in a neat list on the side of the page.</p>

            <p>Netflix has tons of shows and movies so desplaying them neatly is very important. As you move down the page they<br>
            group shows into different catigories but the catigories are seperated by enough white space that you will never get<br>
            confused at which section you are looking at. </p>
